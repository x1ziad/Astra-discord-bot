🔧 ERROR FIXES SUMMARY - DMChannel & PermissionLevel
==================================================

✅ CRITICAL ERRORS RESOLVED

🚨 ERROR 1: DMChannel 'name' attribute error
   ISSUE: 'DMChannel' object has no attribute 'name'
   CAUSE: Code trying to access .name on DM channels (which don't have names)
   SOLUTION: Used getattr(channel, 'name', 'DM') as fallback
   
   FILES FIXED:
   - cogs/ai_companion.py (line 364) - AI response context generation
   - cogs/analytics.py (line 99, 155-156) - Analytics tracking
   - cogs/security_commands.py (line 791) - Security logging
   - utils/discord_data_reporter.py (line 972-973) - Data reporting

🚨 ERROR 2: PermissionLevel.ADMIN enum error
   ISSUE: type object 'PermissionLevel' has no attribute 'ADMIN'
   CAUSE: Code using PermissionLevel.ADMIN instead of ADMINISTRATOR
   SOLUTION: Changed to PermissionLevel.ADMINISTRATOR (correct enum value)
   
   FILES FIXED:
   - cogs/enhanced_server_management.py (line 91) - Setup command
   - cogs/enhanced_security.py (line 424, 488) - Security settings
