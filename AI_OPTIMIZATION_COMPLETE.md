# üéØ ASTRA BOT OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ **REDUNDANT COMMANDS REMOVED**

Successfully removed the following non-essential AI commands that were adding no value:

### **Removed Commands:**
1. **`/ai_personality`** - Redundant personality viewing/modification
2. **`/ai_mood`** - Unnecessary mood analysis functionality  
3. **`/ai_reset`** - Basic conversation reset (handled automatically)
4. **`/ai_topics`** - Trending topics analysis (unused)
5. **`/ai_customize`** - Personality customization (redundant)

### **Why These Were Removed:**
- **No User Value**: Commands rarely used and didn't enhance bot functionality
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Required constant updates and bug fixes
- **Resource Waste**: Consuming memory and processing power unnecessarily
- **Code Complexity**: Added unnecessary complexity to the codebase
- **User Confusion**: Too many commands cluttered the interface

## üöÄ **UNIVERSAL TOKEN MONITORING ENHANCED**

### **New NEXUS Command: `/nexus tokens`**
Replaced the old OpenRouter-specific credit monitoring with a universal system:

**Features:**
- **Universal API Support** - Works with any AI provider
- **Token Usage Optimization** - Real-time efficiency monitoring
- **Cost Analysis** - Estimated savings and efficiency scores
- **Provider Agnostic** - Adapts to different AI services
- **Smart Recommendations** - Automatic optimization suggestions

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
```yaml
Token Configuration: Shows current max_tokens settings
Usage Efficiency: Calculates efficiency scores (0-100)
Cost Analysis: Estimates requests per token budget
Provider Status: Real-time API health monitoring
Optimization Level: Tracks current optimization status
```
